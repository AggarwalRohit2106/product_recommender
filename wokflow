1)  import resnet50 model

2) use whole model as it is just instead of their last layer we are adding our last layer

3) we are giving 44k imgaes on resnet and it return 2048 feature for each image (feature extraciton )

4) now we have a matrix of (44k,2048) i.e each image is now a vector in 2048 dimension space , give new input image to model, return 2048 feature for that input image
   compare it with feature list or matrix. pick close 5 images
